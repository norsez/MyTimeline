		<string>My friends and I embarked on a 4-day trekking mission in Nepal last October (2014) envisioning ourselves standing atop the 3210m high Poon Hill, astounded at the captivating beauty of the Himalayan mountain ranges – Annapurna and Dhaulagiri, to name a few. Himalayan Mountain Trek is an iconic activity you have to do in Nepal.

		<string>October is a perfect season with clear skies and crisp air. There may be intermittent rainshower but it is a generally wonderful weather. The trek requires a moderate level of fitness, only if you’re nothing like us – a bunch of physically unfits. A month of prior training would make a huge difference.

It was an awesome journey. Allow me to take you through it featuring the fascinating views, the freshly-prepared local meals, the decently-organized accommodations, and of course the everyday trekking adventures.</string>
		<string>The charming little town of Pokhara is the closest main entry point to the Annapurna Himalayan region, which is a 7-hour bus ride from Kathmandu. We were picked up from the hostel at 8am and drove for a little over an hour to Nayapul where the trekking proper commences.</string>

		<string>The first day was quite easy but with our poor speed and stamina, it took us 5 hours to reach the village of Hile, where we spent our first night. We hiked through gravel-filled terrain with moderate slopes in between. Amidst all that are the breath-taking mountain views and the refreshingly gushing sound from the nearby streams and waterfalls.</string>
		<string>We decided to have a late lunch in Hile to catch up with our schedule, skipping the small house restaurants that we saw on the way.</string>
		<string>The.Most.Grueling.Day.Of.My.Life.

We woke up at 4:30am for prepping and breakfast and started hiking at 6:55am.  The first couple of minutes were nice and easy, and then the terrain shifted to some torturous, never-ending, rocky upward steps. It was a complete physical bout. BUT, the view of the valleys and hills was absolutely life-giving. Especially when we first caught a glimpse of the Himalayan peaks. It reminded us of why we where there.</string>
		<string>We stopped a number of times as we were extremely exhausted. But the sight of happy and determined like-minded trekkers posed as a great inspiration, let alone the incredible picturesque sceneries. We had our lunch in the village of Mangethanti and stayed for an hour. Ghorepani was still an hour and half away and the thought of it was excruciating enough.

We continued hiking and a rainshower welcomed us in Ghorepani.  When we finally reached our lodge – Mountain View Inn – the face of the Himalayas was right in front of me, I could cry. It was utterly stunning.

The triple room I shared with my friends has a front view of the Annapurna peak, I peered through the window and was totally blown away! The dining area was a good place to meet and greet the other adventure-seekers and where there was an improvised fireplace. My friends and I stayed there to keep warm and chatted the night away. Blissful!</string>
		<string>The ideal take-off time from Ghorepani to Poon Hill is at 4:30am and it takes an hour and a half to ascend it by our standard (slow paced). The magic that transpires during the crack of dawn – the first sun beam kissing the tip of the white mountains – is what Poon Hill is all about. A genuine masterpiece!

It was necessary to summit the hill as this was the highlight of the trek.  It does provide a perfect vantage view of the Himalayas. What it takes is only an ample of labor and toil to get there. I have not recovered from the battering and yet we had to hike up again.  For what it’s worth, I was determined to give it everything I got. The enthralling beauty of these magnificent creations was unspeakable. God is truly amazing in all its glory!

We went back to our Inn for breakfast before we carried on for the day’s journey. We were halfway of the circuit by now but it was still a long way to go.</string>
		<string>We ascended more hills and mountains and trod on more plains, forests, and cliffs. In between all that are the ubiquitous waterfalls with a sound that ironically creates a sense of stillness, peace, and silence. It felt so good.</string>
